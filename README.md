## What is ewd-qoper8?

ewd-qoper8 is a generic, high-performance Node.js-based message queue module.  It provides you with:

- a memory-based queue within your main process onto which you can add JSON messages
- a pool of persistent child processes (aka worker processes) that run your message handler functions
- a worker process pool manager that will start up and shut down worker processes based on demand
- a dispatcher that processes the queue whenever a message is added to it, and attempts to send the message to an available worker process

It differs from most other message queues by preventing a worker process from handling more than one message at a time.  This is by deliberate design.

You determine the maximum size of the worker process pool.  If no free worker processes are available, messages will remain on the queue.  The queue is automatically processed whenever:

- a new message is added to the queue
- a worker process completes its processing of a message and returns itself to the available pool

The structure of messages is entirely up to you, but:

- they are JavaScript objects
- they should always have a type property

How messages are handled within a worker process is up to you.  You define a handler method/function for each message type you expect to be added to the queue.

ewd-qoper8 is highly customisable.   For example, the master and/or worker processes can be customised to connect to any database you wish, and it can be integrated with a Node.js-based web-server module such as Express, and with a web-socket module such as socket.io.  You can also over-ride the memory-based queue and implement your own persistent one.
